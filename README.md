# Blog Application
This is a simple RESTful API for a blog application built with Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. The API allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete blog posts.

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Docker (optional)

## Run Locally
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git clone https://github.com/Hendi-arch/blogpost.git
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd blogpost
```

Build the application:

```bash
  mvn clean install
```

Run the application:

```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start running on **http://localhost:2222**.

## Build and Run with Docker
If you have Docker installed, you can also build and run the application using Docker.

Build the Docker image:

```bash
  docker build -t blog-application .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
  docker run -p 2222:2222 blog-application
```

The application will be accessible at **http://localhost:2222**.

## API Documentation
The API documentation is available in the API Specification file `api-spec.yaml` or you can visit **[Swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/HENDINOF22/blog-api/1.1.0)**.

## How To Use

```

2. Retrieve a single blog post
